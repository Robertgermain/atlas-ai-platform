# Atlas AI Platform — Project State

- Last updated: 2026-08-08
- Phase: Local implementation foundation
- Milestone: PostgreSQL persistence (Milestone 4)
- Implementation status: Milestone 4 committed as `cedaec6` and pushed to `origin/milestone-4-postgres`; awaiting pull-request validation and merge

## Objective

Build a production-oriented deep-research platform that provides interview-defensible experience in applied AI, backend/distributed systems, reliability, observability, delivery, and AWS infrastructure.

## Current direction

A user submits a complex research request. Atlas creates a durable job, plans bounded work, coordinates specialist agents and governed tools, gathers evidence, produces a cited report, grades the result, applies controlled recovery, and exposes progress, quality, cost, and operational diagnostics.

## What exists

- A minimal repository baseline and one flat `docs/` folder.
- `docs/LOCAL_BUILD_PLAN.md` as the ordered local roadmap and milestone checklist.
- Research, product requirements, testing strategy, and a technical-design document with validated local foundation, CI, domain, and persistence decisions.
- Root instructions for AI assistants and this current-state handoff.
- Local environment and ignore files; committed `.env.example` (no secrets).
- Python 3.12 project managed with `uv` (`pyproject.toml`, committed `uv.lock`, `.python-version`).
- `src/atlas` package with FastAPI `GET /health` (liveness) and `GET /ready` (Postgres readiness).
- Pytest, Ruff (format + lint), and mypy configuration; domain, readiness, guard, and PostgreSQL integration tests.
- GitHub Actions CI with Postgres 16 service targeting `atlas_test` (on branch; PR CI not yet run).
- `atlas.domain` package with slotted `ResearchJob`, `reconstitute(...)`, and lifecycle transitions.
- Docker Compose Postgres 16 on host port `5433` with databases `atlas` and `atlas_test`.
- SQLAlchemy 2.x + psycopg3 + Alembic persistence for `research_jobs`, concrete `SqlAlchemyResearchJobRepository`, and explicit `session_scope` transactions (committed on `milestone-4-postgres`; not yet merged to `main`).

## What does not exist

- A comprehensive Visio system-design diagram or approved AWS deployment architecture.
- Merged Milestone 4 changes on `main` (committed and pushed on `milestone-4-postgres`; pull request not opened yet).
- Research-job HTTP API, agents, brokers, Redis, Kafka, pgvector, application Docker image, Kubernetes, Terraform, or AWS resources.
- Validated quality, latency, reliability, or cost benchmarks.

## Decisions

- Keep documentation intentionally small: Research, PRD, Technical Design, Testing Strategy, Local Build Plan, AGENTS, and Project State.
- Build locally through small, tested vertical slices before producing the comprehensive AWS design.
- Update the technical design incrementally as local architectural decisions are validated.
- Create the Visio system and AWS deployment diagrams once working local components provide credible design evidence.
- Add code folders and files incrementally, with an explainable purpose for each.
- Use the technology portfolio through justified capabilities and experiments, not decorative dependencies.
- Track the complete roadmap in `docs/LOCAL_BUILD_PLAN.md`; keep this file limited to current truth and the immediate handoff.
- Runtime dependencies stay in `[project].dependencies`; development tools stay in `[dependency-groups].dev`.
- `requires-python = ">=3.12,<3.13"`; mypy checks both `src` and `tests`.
- Ruff owns formatting and import sorting; black and isort are not used.
- CI installs from the committed lockfile (`uv sync --frozen`) and runs Ruff format, Ruff lint, mypy, and Pytest.
- GitHub Actions are pinned to full commit SHAs with version comments; the workflow has `contents: read` only.
- `astral-sh/setup-uv` uses `version` and `python-version` (not `python-version-file`) for the pinned action.
- Research-job identity is a caller-supplied stripped string; the domain does not generate UUIDs.
- Domain creation always starts in `PENDING`; lifecycle changes go through `start()`, `complete()`, and `fail()` only.
- Durable jobs are rebuilt with `ResearchJob.reconstitute(...)`; persistence mapping does not bypass domain validation.
- Timestamps are timezone-aware, deterministic when supplied, normalized to UTC, and must not move earlier than `updated_at`.
- PostgreSQL is the authoritative store for research jobs; settings use `pydantic-settings` (`ATLAS_DATABASE_URL`).
- Persistence uses sync SQLAlchemy 2.x and psycopg3; repository is a concrete class (no unused Protocol in Milestone 4).
- Integration tests guard destructive operations with SQLAlchemy URL parsing (`atlas_test` or `*_test` only), reset once per suite via `DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE` + `CREATE SCHEMA public` (AUTOCOMMIT), then `alembic upgrade head`, and truncate between tests.
- `/health` is process liveness without DB I/O; `/ready` lazily checks Postgres, maps SQLAlchemy database errors to controlled `503`, and does not hide unexpected programming errors or expose credentials.

## Verification (Milestone 1)

- `uv run python --version` → Python 3.12.13
- `uv sync --frozen` → success
- `uv run ruff check .` → all checks passed
- `uv run mypy src tests` → success (3 source files)
- `uv run pytest` → 1 passed (`GET /health` → `200`, `{"status": "ok"}`)

## Verification (Milestone 2)

### Local

- Removed black and isort from runtime dependencies; regenerated `uv.lock` so Ruff alone owns format and import sorting.
- `uv sync --frozen` → success
- `uv run ruff format --check .` → success
- `uv run ruff check .` → all checks passed
- `uv run mypy src tests` → success
- `uv run pytest` → 1 passed
- Workflow file created with pinned `actions/checkout@v7.0.1` and `astral-sh/setup-uv@v9.0.0` commit SHAs.

### Remote (Pull Request #1)

- Initial CI run passed (green).
- Intentional failure commit `21587a6` caused CI to fail (red).
- Revert commit `2a8190c` restored the correct test and CI passed again (green).
- Pull Request #1 merged to `main`.

### Remote (`main` push after PR #1)

- The push workflow on `main` failed during the `setup-uv` step.
- Cause: unsupported input `python-version-file` for `astral-sh/setup-uv`.

### Remote (Pull Request #2 and `main`)

- Repair commit `9968478` set `version: "0.11.8"`, `python-version: "3.12"`, and `enable-cache: true`.
- Pull Request #2 merged successfully.
- The resulting `main` push workflow passed (green).
- Milestone 2 completion gate is satisfied.

## Verification (Milestone 3)

### Local

- `uv run ruff format --check .` → success
- `uv run ruff check .` → all checks passed
- `uv run mypy src tests` → success
- `uv run pytest` → 50 passed (health + ResearchJob lifecycle)
- Domain package uses standard-library imports only; no FastAPI, database, or agent dependencies.

### Remote (Pull Request #3 and `main`)

- Pull Request #3, `feat: add ResearchJob domain lifecycle`, merged into `main`.
- Pull request CI passed (green).
- The resulting `main` push CI passed (green).
- Milestone 3 completion gate is satisfied.

## Verification (Milestone 4)

### Local

- Docker Compose Postgres 16 healthy with `atlas` and `atlas_test`.
- `uv sync --frozen` → success
- `uv run ruff format --check .` → success
- `uv run ruff check .` → all checks passed
- `uv run mypy src tests` → success (31 source files)
- `ATLAS_DATABASE_URL=.../atlas_test uv run pytest` → 80 passed
- Empty test schema migrates to Alembic head; repository persists across sessions; duplicate-key errors preserve `IntegrityError` cause; test-DB guard rejects non-test URLs without SQL.
- Milestone 4 remains **Current** until PR CI, merge, and the resulting `main` CI succeed; Milestone 5 remains **Pending**.

## Next steps

1. Open the Milestone 4 pull request and confirm CI passes (including Postgres integration tests).
2. Merge the pull request; confirm the resulting `main` push CI is green.
3. After remote validation, mark Milestone 4 **Complete** and Milestone 5 **Current**.
4. Do not begin the research-job HTTP API before that.

## Active blockers

None. Outstanding Milestone 4 completion steps are pull-request CI, merge, and the resulting `main` CI.
